## E-Book

The gap between modern agentic technologies and traditional PHP development has been widening in recent years. While Python developers enjoy a wealth of libraries and frameworks to create AI Agents, PHP developers have often been left wondering how they can participate in this technological revolution without completely retooling their skillsets or rebuilding their applications from scratch.

NeuronAI changes all that.

As a PHP developer, you now stand at a unique intersection of technologies. For years, PHP has powered a substantial portion of the web. Now, with Neuron AI, you can acquire the ability to infuse these web experiences with artificial intelligence, without leaving the language and ecosystem you know and love.

Neuron is the most advanced PHP framework to build AI driven features into existing PHP applications. This book serves as both an introduction to AI Agents concepts for developers and a comprehensive guide to Neuron Agent Development Kit.&#x20;
